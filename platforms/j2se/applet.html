    Setting up JavaGear as an applet is simple, just edit the parameters below and copy
    the relevant html into your webpage.
  
    1/ rom
    
    You can either pass a filename in here, e.g. rom="sonic.sms"
    Or use the RomTool to package a ROM inside the JAR file, and delete this parameter.
    The rom should be in the same directory as the JAR file.
  
  
    2/ width and height
  
    The original SMS is 256x192, and you'll get the best results by scaling this value:
  
       512x384 = 2x original screen size
       640x480 = 2.5 original screen size
       768x576 = 3x original screen size
       
       
    3/ video
    
    Some roms need particular video emulation.
    
    ntsc = NTSC video emulation
    pal  = PAL video emulation

    alt="Your browser understands the &lt;APPLET&gt; tag but isn't running the applet, for some reason."
    Your browser is completely ignoring the &lt;APPLET&gt; tag!
